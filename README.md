# README Generator

## Description
The README Generator is a command-line application that enables users to quickly generate well-structured and professional README.md files for their projects. By prompting users with a series of questions about their project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, and more, the application automatically generates a README.md file with organized sections. This simplifies the process of creating informative and consistent project documentation, saving time and ensuring clarity for developers and collaborators. With the README Generator, users can effortlessly generate README files that effectively communicate project details, contributing to better project management and documentation practices.
